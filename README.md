The project, titled "Smart Security Door Lock System," was built by [Joshua Porunnedath Biju](https://github.com/JOSHUAPBIJU) in collaboration with [Joyel Porunnedath Biju](https://github.com/joyelpbiju), [Sudhakar Hanumanth](https://github.com/sudhanumanth), [Shravanthi Keshavamurthy](https://github.com/shravanthikeshavamurthy), and [Zishnu Viknesh Shivakumar](https://github.com/shivakumarzishnuviknesh7), all students from FH Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project integrates IoT technologies to create a secure, fingerprint-activated door lock with real-time motion detection alerts and remote control capabilities via mobile device.

> [!TIP]  
> Integrate Wi-Fi-enabled connectivity for remote monitoring and control, allowing users to manage access and receive alerts from anywhere.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Regular updates to firmware are necessary to keep up with security advancements and ensure compatibility with the latest mobile technologies.

## System Overview - EVENT TIMELINE

![System Timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JOSHUAPBIJU/Project-Smart-Door-Lock-IoT-System/main/Resource/system-timeline.png)

### Scenario:
_An authorized user uses fingerprint verification to unlock the door, while the systemâ€™s motion detection sensor continuously monitors for any movement near the door. Upon detecting unexpected motion, the system sends an alert to the userâ€™s mobile device via Wi-Fi. Additionally, an intruder attempting to access the system will trigger a series of notifications and an alert._
