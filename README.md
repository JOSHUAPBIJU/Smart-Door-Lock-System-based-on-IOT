# Smart Door Lock System Based on IoT ðŸ”’

An innovative IoT-powered security solution for secure, remote access and monitoring of entry points. This project, developed with the PineCone microcontroller, combines RFID Tag authentication, motion detection, and mobile connectivity to deliver a robust, user-friendly smart lock system.

## Project Overview

The "Smart Security Door Lock System" was developed by [Joshua Porunnedath Biju](https://github.com/JOSHUAPBIJU) in collaboration with [Joyel Porunnedath Biju](https://github.com/joyelpbiju), [Sudhakar Hanumanth](https://github.com/SudhakarH), [Shravanthi Keshavamurthy](https://github.com/SHRAVANTHIK1999), and [Zishnu Viknesh Shivakumar](https://github.com/shivakumarzishnuviknesh7), students from FH Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project leverages IoT technologies to provide secure, RFID based  door access with real-time motion alerts and mobile-based remote control.

> [!TIP]  
> Equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity, the system allows remote monitoring, enabling users to manage access and receive alerts from anywhere.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Regular firmware updates are necessary to keep pace with security advancements and maintain compatibility with the latest mobile technologies.

## System Scenario

_An authorized user verifies their RFID TAG to unlock the door, while a motion sensor monitors for any movement nearby. If unexpected motion is detected, the system immediately sends an alert to the userâ€™s mobile device via Wi-Fi. In the case of a potential intruder, the system triggers a series of notifications to keep the user informed._
